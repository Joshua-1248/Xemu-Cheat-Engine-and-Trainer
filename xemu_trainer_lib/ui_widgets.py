    Make Ctrl+C / Ctrl+X / Ctrl+V happen exactly once per keypress.

    Tk delivers a paste through the <<Paste>> virtual event, which every Entry
    and Text already handles via its CLASS binding. Anything the application
    adds on top - a bind_all("<Control-v>"), or a per-toplevel binding - runs
    IN ADDITION to that class binding, so the text lands twice. Returning
    "break" from the extra handler does not help, because widget and class
    bindings have already fired by the time the toplevel and "all" bindtags are
    reached.

    So the fix is to REPLACE the class bindings rather than layer onto them.
    bind_class() overwrites, and each handler returns "break", which stops the
    toplevel and "all" tags from contributing a second insert. On top of that,
    a guard drops any event whose X serial and target widget match the one just
    handled, which catches the same physical event being delivered twice.
    Serials are per-event and strictly increasing, so two real keypresses never
    collide - an earlier version of this guard used a 30 ms time window instead
    and swallowed legitimate back-to-back pastes.

    These handlers also replace the selection, which Tk's own X11 binding does
    not do - on Linux the stock behaviour is to insert alongside selected text
    rather than over it.
